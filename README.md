# Multi-Vendor-eCommerce-web-app__Laravel-VueJs

I built a multi-vendor eCommerce web app using Vue.js as the front-end and Laravel-PHP as the back-end, the platform enables for vendors to sell their products and for customers to browse and purchase products from multiple vendors in one place.

The complete documentation is coming soon...
